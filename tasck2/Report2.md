### Functional Application: Package Size  

In `task2`, packages have an additional attribute, size (`Size`), which varies randomly between 1 and 4. This change requires all functions to account for and transmit this extra attribute. Additionally, several modifications have been implemented in the truck functionality. The truckâ€™s maximum capacity is now measured in terms of total available space (10 units). There are three distinct behavioral cases:  

1. Package exceeds the truck's remaining space: The package is rejected and redistributed.  
2. Package exactly fills the truck's capacity: The truck dispatches its load.  
3. Package fits in the truck: The package is load and the truck's capacity is updated
